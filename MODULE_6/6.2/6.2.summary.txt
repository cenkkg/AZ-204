"The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)" enables developers to acquire tokens from the Microsoft identity platform 
    in order to authenticate users and access secured web APIs.

The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) can be used to provide secure access to
    Microsoft Graph, 
    other Microsoft APIs,
    third-party web APIs, 
    or your own web API.

MSAL gives you many ways to get tokens, with a consistent API for many platforms. Using MSAL provides the following benefits:
    - No need to directly use the OAuth libraries or code against the protocol in your application.
    - Acquires tokens on behalf of a user or on behalf of an application (when applicable to the platform).
    - Maintains a token cache and refreshes tokens for you when they're close to expire. You don't need to handle token expiration on your own.

Using MSAL, a token can be acquired from many application types: web applications, 
    web APIs, single-page apps (JavaScript), mobile and native applications, and daemons and server-side applications:
        - MSAL for Android
        - MSAL for Android
        - MSAL.js ...

Security tokens can be acquired by multiple types of applications.
    - Public client applications: can not hold configuration-time secrets.
    - Confidential client applications: can hold configuration-time secrets.

+ The client ID (a string representing a GUID)
+ The identity provider URL (named the instance) and the sign-in audience for your application.
     These two parameters are collectively known as the authority.
+ The tenant ID if you're writing a line of business application solely for your organization (also named single-tenant application).
+ The application secret (client secret string) or certificate (of type X509Certificate2) if it's a confidential client app.
+ For web apps, and sometimes for public client apps (in particular when your app needs to use a broker),
     you have to also set the redirectUri where the identity provider connects back to your application with the security tokens.
